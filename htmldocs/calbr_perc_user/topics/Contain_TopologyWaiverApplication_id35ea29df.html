<div class="body MGCBody"><div class="abstract ContainerAbstract"><span class="shortdesc">Calibre
PERC supports automatic error waivers for topological results. These
waivers do not apply to geometric results produced by Logic-Driven
Layout (LDL) flows.</span>
</div>
<p class="p">Here
are examples of when topology waivers are used:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li" id="id35ea29df-4e6b-4cf8-968d-ab173da3a0ee__id5063a1a1-65d1-4a55-9382-43a2a55bbe5c"><p class="p">A chip uses a new ESD protection
scheme, but contains embedded IP that employs the former ESD protection
structures. The IP fails the Calibre PERC checks for the new ESD
scheme, but the results can be waived because the IP produced good
chips in the past.</p>
</li>
<li class="li" id="id35ea29df-4e6b-4cf8-968d-ab173da3a0ee__idc48bad21-cdd2-4431-89ee-5a3a92867ac8"><p class="p">A design block is verified in Calibre
PERC before the full chip is assembled. The block may contain certain
ERC errors because it does not have paths to signals in the context of
a full chip. These errors can be waived when verifying the block
by itself.</p>
</li>
<li class="li" id="id35ea29df-4e6b-4cf8-968d-ab173da3a0ee__id10ee3baf-373c-401c-a502-7cb69931d438"><p class="p">A Calibre PERC rule enforces a
conservative design guideline. The errors from checking this rule
can be waived if they are reviewed by the designer or the foundry
and deemed safe in the context of the specific design.</p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> <p class="p">Waivers are
intended for results that are legitimate errors. They are not intended
to mask numerous “false” results produced by non-optimized rule
checks.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The key input to the topology waiver
flow is a <dfn class="term italic">waiver description file</dfn>,
which is a text file that contains a list of results waiver statements.
Each waiver statement specifies a device or net in a certain cell
that should be waived when checking a particular rule. The waiver
statement can optionally specify a property condition that a result
must satisfy in order to be waived. The waiver description file
is generated by Calibre RVE, or it can be written manually.</p>
<p class="p">When
the <a class="xref Link" href="../../svrf_ur/nsmgchelp.htm" target="_top" onclick="oT('STD_FM11', 'PERC Waiver Path', 'svrf_ur'); return false;">PERC Waiver Path</a> specification statement is used (this statement points
to the waiver description file), Calibre PERC applies waivers to
topology results. A result is waived if it meets the conditions
of at least one waiver statement. Calibre PERC still outputs the
waived results to the report file for analysis and validation, but
waived results do not affect the overall verification status.</p>
<p class="p">In a multithreaded run (-turbo option
is used), waivers are applied by CPUs as assigned by the system.
This leads to better performance as the waivers are applied in parallel
with processing the rule checks.</p>
<p class="p">A multi-user waiver flow is also supported. In this flow, multiple
users can be involved in assessing results and assigning waiver
statuses from the same results database. The results of these users’
status annotations can then be collated by another user (presumably
in a supervisory role) to produce results waivers.</p>
<p class="p">Calibre PERC rule checking runs the same regardless of whether
the topology waiver flow is enabled. Calibre PERC generates the
same set of topological results in the two run modes, but categorizes
them differently when waivers are used. </p>
<p class="p">If the topology waiver flow is disabled,
then Calibre PERC outputs topology results to the report file as
violations. If the topology waiver flow is enabled (<a class="xref Link" href="../../svrf_ur/nsmgchelp.htm" target="_top" onclick="oT('STD_FM11', 'PERC Waiver Path', 'svrf_ur'); return false;">PERC Waiver Path</a> is used), Calibre PERC first applies the waivers to
the results, which transforms the original results to a new (potentially
smaller) set of non-waived results and a set of waived results according
to the outcome of the waiver analysis. Calibre PERC then outputs
the new sets to the report file as violations and waived results.</p>
<p class="p">During rule checking, Calibre PERC captures
a hierarchical result once in a cell, and the result is associated
with a list of the cell placements where the result has occurred.
The waiver algorithm preserves hierarchical results as much as possible.
More specifically, Calibre PERC tries to produce the minimum number
of waived hierarchical results, even though waivers in general are
placement-specific.</p>
<p class="p">Calibre PERC analyzes hierarchical results
one at a time. For each hierarchical result, Calibre PERC temporarily
expands the hierarchical result to a list of flat ones. For each
flat result, Calibre PERC scans all waivers to find an applicable
one. If found, the flat result is waived. A result can be captured
in one cell, but waived by a waiver defined for another cell, as long
as the result matches the waiver description by result promotion
or push-down.</p>
<p class="p">In order to produce the minimum number
of waived hierarchical results, the waiver algorithm goes through
the following two steps for each hierarchical result:</p>
<ul class="ul" id="id35ea29df-4e6b-4cf8-968d-ab173da3a0ee__ida03ed22b-1857-40f1-8684-bda106cdf843"><li class="li" id="id35ea29df-4e6b-4cf8-968d-ab173da3a0ee__id7578b61a-ee01-4963-a329-26aa4fa56409"><p class="p">Step 1</p>
<p class="p">Scan all waivers to find an applicable
one that can waive all placements of the result. If found, the result
is marked as waived using that waiver. In the case where multiple
such waivers are found, the one that does not need result promotion
or the one that appears first in the description file is chosen.
Either way, Calibre PERC generates a single waived hierarchical
result and removes the original result. Otherwise, if the result
cannot be waived by a single waiver, go to Step 2.</p>
</li>
<li class="li" id="id35ea29df-4e6b-4cf8-968d-ab173da3a0ee__id2e4a1271-0b94-470b-881b-8a08c6064b9b"><p class="p">Step 2</p>
<p class="p">Scan all waivers. Keep track of the
placements waived by each waiver. Order the waivers that have waived
at least one placement into a list in descending order based on the
number of waived placements. Calibre PERC loops over the ordered
list and generates a waived hierarchical result for each waiver
as long as there are still waived placements unaccounted for. If
all placements are waived, Calibre PERC removes the original result.
Otherwise, the original result remains, but its associated placement
list is modified to contain only the placements that are not waived.</p>
