SPECIFICATIONS</h2><p class="p">This section summarizes how the aggregate list of hcells used
for the run was comprised. Entries are as follows:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>Hcell file from &lt;-genhcells | -hcell&gt;:   &lt;filename&gt;
Command included -automatch:  &lt;no | yes&gt;
Hcells found in SVRF:         &lt;no | yes&gt;</code></pre><p class="p">The -hcell or -genhcells entries only appear if those options
are used on the command line. If a custom script is specified for
-genhcells, the path to the script and its contents are listed.
The final line pertains to use of the <a class="xref Link" href="../../svrf_ur/nsmgchelp.htm" target="_top" onclick="oT('STD_FM11', 'Hcell', 'svrf_ur'); return false;">Hcell</a> specification
statement (or its TVF equivalent) in the rule file.</p>

EXCLUDED BY LVS EXCLUDE HCELL</h2><p class="p">If any hcells are excluded by an LVS Exclude Hcell statement
in the rule file, then this section of the report appears with a
list of such cells.</p>
</div>
<div class="section Subsection" id="id52f5988c-c6c8-4b8a-be7a-ed61bc8553ba__id3ba6c1d3-828e-43cd-ab47-ed7073f957e8"><h2 class="title Subheading sectiontitle">FAUX
BIN CELLS</h2><p class="p">If faux bin cells are constructed during a
circuit extraction run and the LVS Hcell Report statement was active,
then this section of the report appears. A faux bin cell is a pseudocell (ICV_*
cell) generated by the hierarchical database constructor that can
be traced to a single cell in the original layout design. The pseudocell
name and the corresponding original name are listed in this section.</p>
</div>
<div class="section Subsection" id="id52f5988c-c6c8-4b8a-be7a-ed61bc8553ba__id71fc7d7f-daa6-4b92-89fa-e0a6dab4f78a"><h2 class="title Subheading sectiontitle">CORRESPONDENCE
DETAILS</h2><p class="p">This is the primary section of the report. The section contains
a detailed table with entries related to the handling of hcell correspondences.
The meanings of the names of the columns are largely intuitive and
are defined in <a class="xref fm:Table" href="#id52f5988c-c6c8-4b8a-be7a-ed61bc8553ba__CEGEHDFD">Table 1</a>.</p>
<p class="p">For every pair of cells that Calibre considered
as a potential correspondence, this section provides information
about the pair, whether the correspondence was established, and
if not, why it was rejected. If a pair was established, the report
shows whether any instances of the cells were expanded due to LVS
Expand Unbalanced Cells YES or LVS Flatten Inside Cell. Also, if
circuit extraction identified the layout cell as a high-cost hcell
or was subject to layer operations that degrade hierarchy, the optimization
operation and score are provided whether or not the cell was automatically
expanded during comparison.</p>
<p class="p">The default report form (optionally specified with the BY REJECTION
keyword) and the form specified using the BY HCELL keyword are similar
in many ways, but there are notable differences.</p>
<p class="p">The default report contains a column named “Hcell specification,”
which lists corresponding cell pairs as they were originally specified.
The BY HCELL form replaces the “Hcell specification” column with
a “Rejected” column that lists whether or not a pair was rejected and,
if so, the reason why.</p>
<p class="p">A given potential correspondence can be implied by multiple user-specified
hcells, or by both hcells and the -automatch option. Such a potential
correspondence is only listed once in either report form. In the
default report, it is arbitrary which hcell specification and match
type are listed with it. In the BY HCELL report, the correspondence
appears in only one HCELL SPECIFICATION subheading (described later
in this section).</p>
<p class="p">The default report format contains subsections listed in <a class="xref fm:Table" href="#id52f5988c-c6c8-4b8a-be7a-ed61bc8553ba__CEGIAEDH">Table 2</a>. The CORRESPONDENCES ESTABLISHED
subsection always appears, and it is always the final subsection
if there is more than one. The other subsections appear in arbitrary
order and only when required.</p>
<p class="p">In the default report, if any specified hcells cannot be found
in the layout or source, then they are listed at the end of the
section in a table like this:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>UNMATCHED HCELLS
----------------

  Layout     Source
  name       name       From
  --------   --------   --------
  &lt;cell&gt;     &lt;cell&gt;     &lt;originating source&gt;</code></pre><p class="p">The cell names appear as they do in the originating source for
the hcell specification indicated in the “From” column.</p>
<p class="p">The BY HCELL format contains additional lines as follows:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>HCELL SPECIFICATION - LAYOUT NAME: &lt;layout list name&gt;   SOURCE NAME: &lt;source list name&gt;   FROM: &lt;list origin&gt;</code></pre><p class="p">This shows original names (in the original text case) that appear
in the hcell lists, along with the originating source of the names:
“SVRF” for Hcell statements in the rule file, or a pathname for a
-hcell file or the list generated by a -genhcells script. Under
each subheading, potential correspondences that were rejected are
listed before those that are accepted. These lines can be particularly
helpful when wildcard matching of hcell names is used. </p>
<p class="p">If -automatch is specified on the command line, then the BY HCELL
report includes an AUTOMATCHING subheading, and all potential correspondences
for this matching method are listed afterward. Primary cells are
listed here if not matched elsewhere in the report.</p>
<p class="p">When an hcell specification leads to no potential correspondences,
it is given a subheading in the BY HCELLS report followed by no
line items (an empty subsection). This allows easy identification
of those hcell specifications that did not match any actual cell
pairs. The same holds for AUTOMATCHING subsections. If no cell pairs
were found having matching names, and the top-level cells were explicitly
matched, an empty AUTOMATCHING section will be present.</p>
<p class="p">At the end of this section, there is a legend that lists the
various mnemonics that actually appear as reason codes, along with
their meanings.</p>
</div>
<div class="section Subsection" id="id52f5988c-c6c8-4b8a-be7a-ed61bc8553ba__id734a6e26-bace-4726-a7bb-14c8e3c9d910"><h2 class="title Subheading sectiontitle">LARGEST
FLATTENED CELLS</h2><p class="p">This section lists non-hcells having the greatest
internal instance counts prior to flattening. The cells may be non-hcells
either because they were in no hcell list (including -automatch)
or they were hcells subject to expansion. Up to 20 cells are listed
for each design. Cells in this list might make good hcells.</p>
<p class="p">The layout and source cells are listed separately by name along
with the numbers of instances contained in these cells. The contained
instance counts are broken out into two classes: “Cell” which refers
to cell placements, and “Primitive” which refers to primitive device
instances.</p>
<p class="p">If there are no flattened cells, then this section of the report
is omitted.</p>
</div>
<div class="section Subsection" id="id52f5988c-c6c8-4b8a-be7a-ed61bc8553ba__id6c017c8c-442f-4172-bee3-4a7528312a13"><h2 class="title Subheading sectiontitle">UNBALANCED
HCELLS EXPANDED</h2><p class="p">This section is included only when the WITH EXPANDED keyword
is specified in the LVS Hcell Report statement, and then only when
there is at least one expanded hcell that meets the threshold for
inclusion. The data are formatted as a table with the following
column headings:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>Layout                               Source
----------------------------------   ------------------------------------
Within      Expanded    Placements   Within       Expanded     Placements
cell        cell        expanded     cell         cell         expanded 
----------  ----------  ----------   ----------   ----------   ----------</code></pre><p class="p">Each row in the table represents the expansion of one hcell within
another. The columns labeled “Within cell” contain the layout and
source names for the containing hcell, while those labeled “Expanded
cell” contain the names for the hcell that was expanded. The “Placements expanded”
columns provide the number of placements of the cell that were expanded
into the containing cell in the layout and source circuits. One
row is generated for each pair of hcells where both of the following
are true:</p>
<p class="p BlockIndent">The expanded cell was expanded into the containing
cell due to LVS Expand Unbalanced Cells processing.</p>
<p class="p BlockIndent">The expanded cell's overall placement count in either
the layout or the source circuit (or both) is greater than or equal
to the threshold given in the WITH EXPANDED specification. The overall
placement count here means the sum of the placement counts of the
cell across all other hcells after flattening non-hcells.</p>
<p class="p">In scenarios involving one-to-many correspondences, multiple
rows may be written to provide all the data relating to the expansion
of one correspondence within another.</p>
</div>
<div class="section Subsection" id="id52f5988c-c6c8-4b8a-be7a-ed61bc8553ba__id3d4971fd-6dea-4879-9260-66e26db7c32b"><h2 class="title Subheading sectiontitle">POTENTIAL
HCELL ADDITIONS</h2><p class="p">This section lists any hcells that potentially could make good
hcells, thus providing additional memory and runtime savings. When
present, it identifies certain layout or source non-hcells based
on various metrics.</p>
<p class="p">In each case, a source cell name or a layout cell name is provided.
Since Calibre cannot generally determine how cells in the layout
and source should correspond (no such information exists in GDS,
OASIS, or SPICE), the user must determine how to match such names
in hcell specifications. No distinction is drawn between cells that
did not match any hcell specification and those that were rejected
for some reason, they are both non-hcells.</p>
<p class="p">Two different metrics identify cells that it might benefit performance
to make into hcells: HIC and internal instance count.</p>
<p class="p">The Hierarchical Instance Count (HIC) of a layout or source design
is the sum of instance counts across all that design's hcells after
expanding all non-hcells. Reductions in the HIC tend to correspond
to reduced LVS memory usage and run times. There are two related
subsections in the LVS report, one for the layout circuit and one
for the source circuit. In each case, potential hcells are chosen
by their calculated HIC reduction potential, which is expressed
as a percentage rounded to the nearest integer. For each such cell,
the cell name and percentage are listed in the appropriate subsection. </p>
<p class="p">The actual HIC reduction that occurs upon making one of these
cells an hcell may be different from the calculated potential due
to factors like unbalanced hcell expansion, which the simple calculations
done for this report do not account for. The Query Server's hcell
analyzer accounts for such factors, however. Also note that the
HIC reduction potential for each listed cell is calculated assuming
that the given cell is added as an hcell and all else remains constant. Therefore,
though several cells may be listed, once one of them is converted
to an hcell, the calculations for the others are no longer valid.
The hcell analyzer solves this by updating the calculations after
each hcell is chosen, and before identifying the next candidate.
For these reasons, the hcell analyzer is the preferred tool for
finding potential hcell additions. A generic message to that effect
appears in this subsection of the report.</p>
<p class="p">Up to three source cells and three layout cells may be listed.
Each is a non-hcell with a potential to improve the HIC in its circuit
by at least five percent. Large cells are defined as those whose internal
instance count is at least one percent of the total flat instance
count of the circuit. Such cells are often good choices for hcells.
Subsections are provided to list the large cells in the source and
layout designs. Each such subsection provides a list of cell names
with instance counts.</p>
<p class="p">All empty subsections are omitted. For example, if there are
no large cells in the source design, there will be no subsection
for them. If there are no cells to list in any of the subsections,
the entire section is omitted.</p>
