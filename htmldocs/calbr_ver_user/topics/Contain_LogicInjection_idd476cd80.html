<div id="BodyContent"><h1 class="title topictitle1">Logic
Injection</h1>
<div class="body MGCBody"><div class="abstract ContainerAbstract"><span class="shortdesc">Logic
injection is an algorithm in hierarchical circuit comparison that
is designed to reduce memory consumption by replacing common logic
circuits with new, primitive elements. </span>
</div>
<p class="p">For example, an
SRAM bit structure consisting of six MOS devices is replaced by
a single primitive element. The original devices and related data
structures are then removed from memory. The new, primitive elements
are called <dfn class="term italic">injected components</dfn>.
In addition to memory consumption, execution time is often reduced.</p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> <p class="p">MOS devices having more than
four pins do not participate in logic injection.</p>
</div>
<p class="p">The
injected components retain all necessary information about the original
devices: instance names, types, subtypes, and properties. When an
injected component, or one of its original devices, is involved
in a discrepancy, this information is included in the LVS report
(see the section on the LVS report on “<a class="xref fm:HeadingAndPage" href="Concept_InjectedComponentsLvsReport_idfd2a9ef7.html#idfd2a9ef7-11ae-42e9-864b-73ae2678a726__Concept_InjectedComponentsLvsReport_idfd2a9ef7.xml#idfd2a9ef7-11ae-42e9-864b-73ae2678a726" title="From the user’s perspective, components created by logic injection behave largely like logic gates. Injected components appear in the LVS Report in each cell where injection takes place. They are listed similarly to logic gates in the NUMBERS OF OBJECTS AFTER TRANSFORMATION section, and also in the INFORMATION AND WARNINGS section where counts of matched and unmatched instances are given. All injected components have predefined names that start with an underscore (_).">Injected Components and the LVS Report</a>”).</p>
<p class="p">If cross-reference information is requested,
corresponding original devices are written out. This can be done
using either the -ixf command line option or the <a class="xref Link" href="../../svrf_ur/nsmgchelp.htm" target="_top" onclick="oT('STD_FM11', 'Mask SVDB Directory', 'svrf_ur'); return false;">Mask SVDB Directory</a> IXF keyword.</p>
<p class="p">Logic injection is done in every hcell
(including the top-level cell) after instances in the cell are flattened
and transformed, but before logic gates are recognized. Injection
is done separately in layout and source. This means that Calibre
nmLVS-H first creates an internal representation of a cell with
all its devices before it can inject logic and remove some of those
devices. This fact has an important implication for memory savings
provided by logic injection: logic injection is more efficient when
the design contains several large blocks that serve as hcells. If
there are no hcells at all, logic injection can reduce memory consumption
by no more than half, because each half of the design—layout and
source—must be represented in memory fully before injection takes
place. If the design is partitioned into several large blocks, memory
savings from logic injection can be significantly higher.</p>
<p class="p">When recognizing the circuits to inject,
logic injection ignores user-given names inside hcells. Only user-given
names in the top-level cell are preserved by logic injection and
they prevent injection if they appear on internal nets of injected
circuits. This makes logic injection behave similarly to gate recognition
with respect to preservation of user-given names. </p>
<p class="p">Automatic detection of swappable hcell
pins is enabled as appropriate.</p>
<p class="p">The best-case candidates to benefit from
logic injection are designs with significant embedded-memory content,
where the embedded-memory blocks have similar sizes, serve as hcells,
but are, in turn, processed mostly at the transistor level (that
is, they contain no significant hcells inside).</p>
<p class="p">The maximum possible impact of logic
injection on memory consumption is listed for every type of injected
structure. The current theoretical limit is 4.7× savings (by injecting
SRAM bit structures).</p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> <p class="p">If the design already has an adequate
hcell list, then logic injection may provide no benefit; in some
cases, there may even be a slight penalty in run time or memory
consumption.</p>
</div>
<p class="p">Logic injection operates only in hierarchical
LVS. Logic injection is controlled by the <a class="xref Link" href="../../svrf_ur/nsmgchelp.htm" target="_top" onclick="oT('STD_FM11', 'LVS Inject Logic', 'svrf_ur'); return false;">LVS Inject Logic</a> specification statement. This statement may appear
at most once. The default value is YES.</p>
<p class="p">When logic injection is enabled, the
transcript reflects this. First, for each cell, the injection step is
reported as it is done, as follows:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock leveled"><code>Logic Injection.  CPU TIME = 0  REAL TIME = 0</code></pre><p class="p">Second, after the last cell undergoes
logic injection, an injection summary is printed out in the transcript,
which reports how many devices of different kinds were injected.</p>
